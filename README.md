This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Hack where a function call compiles successfully but leads to a runtime crash because the referenced function is not defined within the Hack runtime environment. The bug.hack file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.hack provides the corrected version. The issue arises from using a function (print_int) that is not part of the standard Hack library.  The solution replaces this with a Hack-compatible print function.
